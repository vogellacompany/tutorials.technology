== Using the Gerrit web interface

[[webreview_reviewchangerequest]]
=== Reviewing a change request

Click on one change request to see the details of the Gerrit change request. 
Click on the commit message of the file name (highlighted in the screenshot) to see the changes in the file.

You can double-click on a line to comment on the change.

Clicking on _Up to change_ brings you back to the change.

Gerrit allows you to review the commit message, which appears at the top of the file list.
To understand the history of the repository it is important to provide a good commit message.

[[webreview_reviewresult]]
=== Publishing your review result

Click on _Reply_ button to give feedback on the change.

image::webreview12.png[Web review]

You can give a summary of your feedback and return a review
number between -2 and +2 (if you are a committer) or
between
-1 and
+1 (if you are not a committer). If you vote -1 or
-2, you respectively indicate that the patch still
requires
rework
or that you
disagree with the suggested change. See
<<gerrit_voting>>
for details of the default voting rules.

[[webreview_adjustingthechange]]
=== Improve a change based on review feedback

If the review process has resulted review comments explaining
how to
improve the proposed patch, the author of the
patch (or someone
else)
can adjust the
patch. The developer
amends the
commit in his local
repository and
pushes the
improved commit
to Gerrit. He can
also
adjust
the
commit
message while amending the commit.

As the developer amends the commit, the same
_Change-Id_
is used and the
Gerrit review system identifies the change as update
of the existing change.

The _Git Staging_ view allows amending the last commit by clicking the amend button shown in the screenshot.

TIP: Gerrit allows you to select which patch sets you want to compare in
_Comparison_
view. Typically you compare the base version with the latest patch
set, but if e.g. you already reviewed patch set 3
you may want to
just see what the author changed between patchset 3 and patchset 5.

Once the change has reached the required quality, the reviewer can give a +2 evaluation of the change.

Depending on the settings of the Gerrit repository, the Gerrit review might have to be rebased.
If you conflict happens during this rebase operation, you can trigger this rebase directly from the web interface.
If a change is rebased, it needs to be reviewed again.

image::webreview40.png[Web review]

Afterwards a developer with commit rights can submit the change.
This is typically done by the same committer who voted +2.
This may require that the corresponding commit is based on the current origin/master branch. 
This depends on the Gerrit configuration for the project.
The Gerrit UI allows the committer or contributor to rebase the change onto origin/master if no conflicts occur.

[[webreview_keyboardshortcuts]]
=== Keyboard shortcuts in Gerrit

Press the "?" key in the Gerrit web user interface to see the
actions you
can trigger via shortcuts. The available
shortcuts depend
on there you are in the user interface.

The available shortcuts are different, depending on the page
your are.

[[webreview_getting]]
=== Fetching a remote change into a local Git repository

It is possible to fetch the changes from the Gerrit review into
another local Git
repository. The Gerrit page
lists the
commands for
downloading the change. This is depicted in the following screenshot.

image::webreviewpull10.png[Pulling in the change]

After fetching a change, the developer can adjust the change and
amend the commit.
If he pushes it to Gerrit, the
change is updated.
Such a
procedure
should be coordinated by the author of the original
change
to avoid
that two developers
do the same work.

[[webreview_gettingeclpise]]
=== Fetching a remote change with Eclipse Git

TIP: The Git tooling in Eclipse allows you to fetch a change from Gerrit.
For this, right-click on
the project
menu:Team[Remote > Fetch from Gerrit].

When working with many projects, it is often easier to right-click on the repository instead and access btn:[Fetch from Gerrit] from there.
You can paste the change's number (shown in the change's URL) and use kbd:[Ctrl+Space] to expand the change number to the list of patch sets.
Select the one you want to download and fetch it into a new local branch.
Afterwards you can to test the changes in isolation.

[[webreview_editintheweb]]

You can also edit directly in Gerrit. Press the edit button for this.

image::editingerrit10.png[Edit in Gerrit]

Afterwards select the file or the commit message you want to edit. 
Press save and close once you are done. 
After you are done with all your edits, press the _Publish Edit_.
