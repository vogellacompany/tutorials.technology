==== 2. The change is submitted but the merge is pending
If the status changed to 'Submitted, Merge Pending' then the change
depends on another change that is still open (in review). In that case
the change will be merged automatically once all its dependencies are
submitted and merged.

==== 3. The submit fails due to merge conflicts
It may also happen that the submit fails due to merge conflicts. In
that case you will have to resolve the merge conflicts in your local
branch and then push another patch set. The steps are:

* Fetch the changes from upstream. This updates the local 'origin/master' branch to
  its latest state. Rebase your feature branch to the 'origin/master'. If you get conflicts resolve 
  these conflicts.
* Commit your adjustments using the 'amend' option.
* Push to the upsteam again. 

* After that a new patch set is created for this change. The new patch
  set has again to pass the code reviewa again.
* Submit the change again once it passes the code review
