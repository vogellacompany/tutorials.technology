== Things to consider if you want to contribute to an existing project
	<section id="contribution_whattofix">
=== How to start contributing?
		It is typically a good approach to fix something really simple
			as the
			first
			step. Search for a few warning messages
			in the code, or a
			typo
			in the
			documentation, and prepare a fix for it.
		
		
			Once you get familiar with the contribution process start
			contributing something more difficult.
		

	<section id="contribution_scope">
=== Scope of a Gerrit change / commit
		
			A Gerrit change (== one commit) should address only one issue.
		
		
			Avoid going "off topic" with your patches. If you would like to
			clean up some code, or fix something out of the
			scope of your patch,
			create additional patches. This will make your patches
			more
			concise,
			easier to review and
			easier to
			revert if something go wrong.
		
		
			In many open source projects smaller patches tend to be reviewed
			faster
			and merged faster as it is easier for the
			committer to
			review.
			With this in mind, try to break your contributions into small
			concise
			Gerrit changes. It is more
			likely that these get reviewed and
			accepted.
		
		It also helps to reach a clean history. Imagine you are chasing
			a bug in code which was introduced 2 years back.
			If the history is
			built from small concise commits, it is easier to find the commit
			which introduced the problem and
			understand the motivation why it was
			done in the way it was implemented.
		

	<section id="contribution_commitmessagegerrit">
=== Commit message
		Most project handles the required commit message a bit
			differently. For example, the Eclipse Platform project
			prefers the
			following
			format:
[source,java]
-----
include::res/commitmessage/header.txt[]
----
		
		The text in the header must match the title in Bugzilla. The Eclipse Git tooling complains about commit headers
			longer than 80, but
			you can ignore this warning. For
			example the following is a valid commit message for
			the Eclipse
			platform project. The
			description in the body of the commit message
			can take as
			many lines as necessary and
			should be
			descriptive of what
			is
			going
			into the patch. For more complex patches you should provide
			implementation
			details and enough
			notes to allow the
			reviewer to
			understand what your fix provides.
		
		
			<programlisting language="text">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/commitmessage/example.txt[]
----
		
		It is important to explain in the commit body, why the change
			was done. Also explain why you have chosen a
			certain
			implementation method, if there was something special about it.
		
		<tip>
			Don't worry too much about the correct commit message format,
				the project you
				are contributing to will also
				review your commit
				message.
			
		

	<section id="contribution_copyrightheader">
=== Copyright header update
		In some projects the source file contains a copyright header. If you modify the
			file you should also update the
			copyright header. Different project might use different standards here. Have a look at existing commits and the
			header in the
			existing files and try to adapt the style preferred by the existing developers.
		

	<section id="contribution_copyrightheader_platformui">
=== Example: Copyright header in Eclipse Platform UI

		
			The Eclipse platform project for example requires you to update the copyright header with the last modified
			year. Optionally you can also
			add
			yourself to the copyright
			with a reference to the
			bug. The following
			listing
			shows an
			example for this standard.
		

		
			<programlisting language="plain">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/copyright/header.txt[]
----
		

		
			The above file was created in 2008 and last modified in 2015. It
			was
			originally created by employees of IBM and
			also
			modified by John
			Doe
			and he fixed Bug 429728 with it. The additional entry in the
			_Contributors_
			section is
			typically considered
			optional, but this depends on the
			individual project.
		

		
			If you work for an organization the Foundation recommends
			adding the
			organization name in parentheses. See:
			http://www.eclipse.org/legal/copyrightandlicensenotice.php">Copyright info from eclipse.org
			</ulink>
			.
			For
			example:
		
		
			`
				John Doe (vogella GmbH) <![CDATA[<John.Doe@fake.com>]]>
				- Bug 429728 - Fixed compiler warnings
			`
		
		If you add a new file don't forget to add the copyright header
			using the project's license. For new files, list
			"yourself and
			others"
			instead of "IBM and
			others" in the first line.
		


		If you fix several bugs in the same file, you should list the
			bug separately as in the following example listing.
			In case you find
			yourself changing the same file over
			and over again, you could also
			use "ongoing maintenance" instead
			of
			listing every bug number.
		
		
			<programlisting language="plain">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/copyright/header2.txt[]
----
		


		In most cases you should avoid putting in the bug number into
			the source code (except the header). Only if you
			have to implement a
			workaround for an existing bug, you should add a reference in the
			source to this bug.
		


	<section id="contribution_polite">
=== Stay polite
		The best way to get your contribution accepted is to stay
			polite
			and to follow the guidance of the existing
			committers. For the first few contributions it is best to stay with the
			current processes and guidelines.
			If you
			continue to contribute, you will gain more trust and
			responsibility
			and
			you may be able to improve also the
			processes
			used
			by
			the
			project.
		




	<section id="contribution_formatting">
=== Avoid unnecessary formatting changes
		
			Typically open source projects dislike if you re-format unchanged
			lines,
			as this makes the review process much harder.
			Avoid pressing the
			_Format source code_
			shortcut in your editor. Instead, only select the changes lines and
			then press the format source code shortcut (this
			is also an
			auto-save
			preference).
		
		Unnecessary format changes makes it really hard to review a
			Gerrit change. The following screenshot shows a file
			which was
			reformatted, it is unnecessary hard for the reviewer to find the
			real
			change.

				<textobject>
					<phrase>Demonstrates unnecessary formatting changes</phrase>
				</textobject>
			</mediaobject>
		



	<section id="contribution_whitespace">
=== Avoid unnecessary whitespace changes
		Typically projects dislike unnecessary whitespace in
			the
			contributed code. Ensure that you remove trailing
			whitespaces from
			your contributed code.
		
		Unfortunately lots of project have unnecessary whitespace
			included in the source code, most committers also don't
			like if you
			remove them as it changes the history.
		


	<section id="contribution_pushunfinished">
=== Pushing unfinished features
		For most projects it is OK to push an initial
			(unfinished)
			implementation
			concept to Gerrit and to ask for
			feedback.
		
		Mark unfinished commits with [RFC] (request for comments) or
			[WIP] (work in progress) in the commit message
			header to avoid
			frustrating reviewers who typically want to know if the change is
			considered to be ready by the author
			or not.
		
		<tip>
			
				In general you should develop
				in the open as much as possible to
				avoid the unpleasant
				surprise that your perfect
				contribution is
				rejected because it does
				not fit into the design of
				the software.
			
		


	<section id="contribution_validuserpassword">
=== Valid user and email
		Some project uses additional validation plug-ins. For example the Eclipse foundation uses a server-side Gerrit
			plugin which
			checks for
			conformity
			with
			the CLA. When you push a change to Gerrit
			this plugin verifies if your
			contribution
			passes
			all the CLA
			requirements from the Eclipse
			foundation.
		
		
			This means that
			the author field must be a valid Eclipse user. If
			the
			author is not
			a committer it requires that the
			author also
			"Sign-off" their
			contribution. Eclipse Git provides a preference to
			always sign-off changes.
		
		
			See:
			https://wiki.eclipse.org/Development_Resources/Handling_Git_Contributions">Wiki for Git contributions
			</ulink>

		





	<section id="contribution_nofeedback">
=== Not getting feedback
		If everything works perfectly, the developers of the project you are contributing to will
			accept
			your contribution
			and help you to solve all your open
			questions.
		
		If you don't get feedback there are different possible reasons:
			maybe all committers are busy or in vacation. Or
			your change is
			extremely large (hard to review) or it ignores all the rules
			explained in the project's contributor
			guide.
		
		If your contribution is
			ignored, feel
			free to ask in
			the Bug report
			for feedback or to send
			email to the
			project
			mailing
			list.
		


	<section id="contribution_rudefeedback">
=== Dealing with negative feedback
		
			Don't get
			frustrated by negative feedback, as the collaboration
			almost
			always
			results in a better commit that
			benefits everyone.
