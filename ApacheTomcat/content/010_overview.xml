== Apache Tomcat</title>
	<para> Apache Tomcat is a webcontainer which allows to run servlet and
		JavaServer Pages (JSP) based web applications. Most of the modern Java
		web
		frameworks are based on servlets, e.g.
		JavaServer Faces, Struts,
		Spring.
	</para>
	<para> Apache Tomcat also provides by default a HTTP connector on port
		8080, i.e., Tomcat can also be used as HTTP server. But the
		performance of Tomcat is not as good as the performance of a
		designated web server, like the Apache
		HTTP server.
