			http://localhost:8080
		
		This should show a web page similar to the following.

=== Admin console
		Tomcat provides a webbased adminstration console which can be
			started via the following link: http://localhost:8080/manager/html
		


		
			The available users can be found in the
			`tomcat-users.xml`
			file of the Tomcat configuration directory, i.e., the
			`/etc/tomcat/tomcat-users.xml`
			file under Ubuntu.
		
		
			On Ubuntu the user for the administrator console is not created
			automatically,
			you have to add the
			user entry manually to the
			`
				/etc/tomcat7/tomcat-users.xml
			`
			. The following listing gives an example for a user. To get more
			information try to login and see the resulting error message. Once
			you entered a user and a password, restart the Tomcat server to
			ensure your new users is activated.
		

		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/install/user.txt" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			The default user for the Tomcat administration console under Windows
			is
			<wordasword>admin</wordasword>
			with the
			<wordasword>admin</wordasword>
			password.

=== Deployment
		
			The standard deployment format for webapplications is a
			`.war`
			file.
			If
			you create a war application just put this application
			into
			the
			`webapps`
			folder. The next time tomcat starts it will unpack
			the
			war
			and make the
			application available.
		

		 Web applications may require external libraries. Typically, web
			application contain their own libraries but if you want to make
			certain libraries available for all applications you can put them
			into
			the
			folder
			"lib" and a subfolder below "lib". These libraries are
			then available
			for all web
			applications.
