=== What is Apache Ant?
		
			_Apache Ant_
			(Ant) is a general purpose build tool. Ant is an abbreviation for
			_Another Neat Tool_
			.
		

		
			Ant
			is primarily used for building and deploying
			Java
			projects but
			can be
			used for every possible repetitive tasks, e.g. generating
			documentation.

=== Configuring Apache Ant
		
			A Java build
			process typically includes:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem> the compilation of the Java source code into Java
					bytecode
				</listitem>
				<listitem> creation of the .jar file for the distribution of the
					code
				</listitem>
				<listitem> creation of the Javadoc documentation</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		
		
			Ant
			uses an
			`xml`
			file for its configuration. The default file name is
			`build.xml`
			.
			Ant
			builds are based on three blocks:
			_tasks_
			,
			_targets_
			and
			_extension points_
			.
		
		
			A
			task
			is a unit of work which should be performed and
			are small,
			atomic
			steps,
			for example compile source code or create
			Javadoc.
			Tasks
			can be grouped into
			targets.
		

		
			A
			target
			can be directly invoked via Ant.
			Targets
			can
			specify their
			dependencies.
			Ant
			will automatically execute all dependent
			targets.
		
		
			For example if
			target
			A
			depends on
			B and Ant is instructed to run A,
			it first runs B before running A.
		
		
			In your
			`build.xml`
			file you can
			specify
			the default
			target.
			Ant
			executes
			this target, if no
			explicit target
			is specified.
