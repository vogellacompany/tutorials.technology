== Multi module projects (Aggregator)

Maven supports building multiple projects. 
A multi module project (aggregator) is defined by a parent POM referencing one or more projects. 
This aggregator can contain also the build configuration or include another parent POM to get this configuration.

[source,xml]

The packaging type of such a POM is pom, as such a project will not result in any build output.
