=== git shortlog for release announcements
((git shortlog))
The `git shortlog` command summarizes the `git log` output. 
It groups all commits by author and includes the first line of the commit message.

The `-s` option suppresses the commit message and provides a commit
count. The `-n` option sorts the output based on the number of commits
by author.

[source,console]
----
# gives a summary of the changes by author
git shortlog

# compressed summary
# -s summary, provides a commit count summary only
# -n sorted by number instead of name of the author
git shortlog -sn
----

This command also allows you to see the commits done by a certain author or committer.

[source,console]
----
# see the commits by the author "Lars Vogel"
git shortlog --author="Lars Vogel"

# see the commits by the author "Lars Vogel" 
# restricted by the last years
git shortlog --author="Lars Vogel" --since=2years
