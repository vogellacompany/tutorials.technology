=== Commit history of a repository or certain files

http://git-scm.com/docs/gitk[Gitk] can be used to visualize the history of a repository of certain files.

In some cases simply using `git blame` is not sufficient in order to see all details of certain changes. 
You can navigate to the file location in the target git repository and use the `gitk [filename]` command to see all commits of a file in a clear UI.

In this screenshot we can see all commits of the `ShowViewHandler.java` by using the `gitk ShowViewHandler.java` command:

On Linux you can easily install gitk by using the `sudo apt-get install gitk` command in a terminal.

See http://git-scm.com/docs/gitk for further information.
