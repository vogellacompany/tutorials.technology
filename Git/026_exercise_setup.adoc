== Exercise - Setting up Git via the command line

In this exercise you configure your user and email which is a required setup for Git. 
You also configure Git to use _rebase_ during a pull operation which is also a common setting for Git.

Configure your user and email for Git via the following command.

[source,console]
----
# configure the user which will be used by Git
# this should be not an acronym but your full name
git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"

# configure the email address
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.org"

# use rebase instead of merge in the `git pull` command.
# this avoids merge commits during the pull operation
git config --global branch.autosetuprebase always
