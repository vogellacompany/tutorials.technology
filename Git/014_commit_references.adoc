[[commitreference]]

== Commit references

[[commitreference_whatis]]

=== Predecessor commits, parents and commit references

(((Commit references)))

(((Simple reference)))
 
(((Symbolic reference))))

Each commit has zero or more direct predecessor commits. The first commit has
zero parents, merge commits have two or more parents, most commits have
one parent.

In Git you frequently want to refer to certain commits. For
example, you want to tell Git to show you all changes which were done in
the last three commits. Or you want to see the differences introduced
between two different branches.

Git allows addressing commits via _commit reference_ for this purpose.

A commit reference can be a _simple reference_ (simple ref), in this
case it points directly to a commit. This is the case for a commit hash
or a tag. A commit reference can also be _symbolic reference_ (symbolic
ref, symref). In this case it points to another reference (either simple
or symbolic). For example HEAD is a symbolic ref for a branch, if it
points to a branch. HEAD points to the branch pointer and the branch
pointer points to a commit.

[[commitreference_branchheadreferences]]

=== Branch references and the HEAD reference

(((Commit references, Branch)))
(((Commit references, HEAD)))

A branch points to a
specific commit. You can use the branch name as reference to the
corresponding commit. You can also use HEAD to reference the
corresponding commit.

[[commitreference_parentancestor]]

=== Parent and ancestor commits

You can use ^ (caret) and ~ (tilde) to reference predecessor commit
objects from other references. You can also combine the ^ and ~
operators. See <<commitreference_carettilde>> for their usage.

The Git terminology is _parent_ for ^ and _ancestor_ for ~.

[[commitreference_carettilde]]

=== Using caret and tilde for commit references

(((caret and tilde for predecessor commit references)))

[reference]~1 describes the first
predecessor of the commit object accessed via [reference]. [reference]~2
is the first predecessor of the first predecessor of the [reference]
commit. [reference]~3 is the first predecessor of the first predecessor
of the first predecessor of the [reference] commit, etc.

[reference]~ is an abbreviation for [reference]~1.

For example, you can use the _HEAD~1_ or _HEAD~_ reference to access the
first parent of the commit to which the _HEAD_ pointer currently points.

[reference]^1 also describes the first predecessor of the commit object
accessed via [reference].

For example HEAD^^^ is the same as HEAD~~~ and is the same as HEAD~3.

The difference is that [reference]^2 describes the second parent of a
commit. A merge commit typically has two predecessors. HEAD^3 means ‘the
third parent of a merge’ and in most cases this won’t exist (merges are
generally between two commits, though more is possible).

[reference]^ is an abbreviation for [reference]^1.

[[commitreference_ranges_doubledot]]

=== Commit ranges with the double dot operator

(((Commit ranges, double dot operator)))

You can also specify ranges of commits. This is useful for certain Git
commands, for example, for seeing the changes between a series of
commits.

The double dot operator allows you to select all commits which are
reachable from a commit c2 but not from commit c1. The syntax for this
is "c1..c2". A commit A is reachable from another commit B if A is a
direct or indirect parent of B.

[TIP]
====
Think of c1..c2 as _all commits as of c1 (not including c1) until commit
c2._
====

For example, you can ask Git to show all commits which happened between
HEAD and HEAD~4.

This also works for branches. To list all commits which are in the "master"
branch but not in the "testing" branch, use the following command.

[source,console]
----
include::./examples/ranges/logranges2[]

You can also list all commits which are in the "testing" but not in the "master" branch.

[[commitreference_ranges_tripledot]]

=== Commit ranges with the triple dot operator

(((Commit ranges, triple dot operator)))

The triple dot operator allows you to select all
commits which are reachable either from commit c1 or commit c2 but not
from both of them.

This is useful to show all commits in two branches which have not yet
been combined.
