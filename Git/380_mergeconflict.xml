=== What is a conflict during a merge operation?
		
			LARSPRIMARYINDEX"Merge conflict"LARSPRIMARYINDEX
		
		A conflict during a merge operation
			occurs
			if two commits from
			different
			branches
			have modified the same
			content
			and Git cannot
			automatically
			determine
			how both changes
			should be
			combined when merging
			these branches.
		
		This happens for example if the same line in a file has been
			replaced by
			two different commits.
		
		 If a conflict occurs, Git marks the conflict in the
			file
			and the
			programmer has to resolve the conflict manually.
		
		After
			resolving it, he adds the file to the staging area and
			commits the
			change. These steps are required to finish the merge
			operation.

=== Keep a version of a file during a merge conflict

			Sometimes if a conflict occurs the developer does not want to
			solve
			the
			conflict. He decides that he wants to keep the
			original
			version or
			the new
			version of the file.
		
		
			For this, there is the
			`--theirs`
			and the
			`--ours`
			options on the
			`git checkout`
			command. The first option keeps the version
			of the file
			that you merged
			in, and the second option keeps the version before the merge
			operation was started.
