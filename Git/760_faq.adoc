== Can Git handle symlinks?

((((symlinks)))

The usage of symlinks
requires that the operating system used by the developers supports them.

Git as version control system can handle symlinks.

If the symlink points to a file, then Git stores the path information it
is symlinking to, and the file type. This is similar to a symlink to a
directory; Git does not store the contents under the symlinked
directory.
