[[remotes_definition]]

=== What are remotes?

(((Repository, remote)))
(((Remote repositories)))
_Remotes_ are URLs in a Git
repository to other remote repositories that are hosted on the Internet,
locally or on the network.

Such remotes can be used to synchronize the changes of several Git
repositories. A local Git repository can be connected to multiple remote
repositories and you can synchronize your local repository with them via
Git operations.

[NOTE]
====
Think of _remotes_ as shorter bookmarks for repositories. You can always
connect to a remote repository if you know its URL and if you have
access to it. Without _remotes_ the user would have to type the URL for
each and every command which communicates with another repository.
====

It is possible that users connect their individual repositories
directly, but a typically Git workflow involves one or more remote
repositories which are used to synchronize the individual repository.
Typically the remote repository which is used for synchronization is
located on a server which is always available.

[TIP]
====
A remote repository can also be hosted in the local file
system.

[[bareremotes_definition]]

=== Bare repositories

(((Repository, bare)))
(((Bare repository)))
A remote repository on a server typically does
not require a _working tree_. A Git repository without a _working tree_
is called a _bare repository_. You can create such a repository with
the `--bare` option. The command to create a new empty bare remote
repository is displayed below.

[source,console]
----
include::./examples/create/gitinitbare.txt[] 
----

By convention the name of a bare repository should end with the `.git`
extension.

To create a bare Git repository in the Internet you would, for example,
connect to your server via the SSH protocol or you use some Git hosting
platform, e.g., GitHub.com.

[[bareremotes_convert]]

=== Convert a Git repository to a bare repository

Converting a normal Git repository to a bare repository is not directly support by Git.

You can convert it manually by moving the content of the `.git` folder
into the root of the repository and by removing all others files from
the working tree. Afterwards you need to update the Git repository
configuration with the `git config core.bare true` command.

As this is officially not supported, you should prefer cloning a
repository with the `--bare` option.

[[remotes_cloneoperation]]

=== Cloning a repository

(((Repository)))
(((Clone repository with Git)))
(((Protocols supported by Git)))
The `((git clone))` command copies an existing Git repository. 
This copy is a working Git repository with the complete history of the cloned repository. 
It can be used completely isolated from the original repository.

Git supports several transport protocols to connect to other Git
repositories; the native protocol for Git is also called `git`.

The following command clones an existing repository using the Git
protocol. The Git protocol uses the port 9148 which might be blocked by
firewalls.

[source,console]
----
include::./examples/remote/checkout.txt[]
----

If you have SSH access to a Git repository, you can also use the `ssh`
protocol. The name preceding @ is the user name used for the SSH
connection.

[source,console]
----
include::./examples/remote/checkoutssh.txt[] 
----

Alternatively you could clone the same repository via the `http` protocol.

[source,console]
----
include::./examples/remote/checkouthttp.txt[]
---- 

[[remote_add]]
=== Adding remote repositories

(((origin)))
If you clone a repository, Git implicitly creates a _remote_ named _origin_ by default. 
The _origin_ _remote_ links back to the cloned repository.

You can push changes to this repository via `git push` as Git uses `origin`
as default. Of course, pushing to a remote repository requires write
access to this repository.

You can add more _remotes_ via the
`git remote add [name] [URL_to_Git_repo]`
command. For example, if you cloned the repository from above via the
Git protocol, you could add a new remote with the name _github_http_ for
the http protocol via the following command.

[source,console]
----
include::./examples/add/addremote.txt[]
----

[[remote_rename]]
=== Rename remote repositories

To rename an existing remote repository use the `git remote rename`
command. This is demonstrated by the following listing.

[source,console]
----
include::./examples/add/renameremote.txt[]
----

If you create a Git repository from scratch with the `git init` command,
the _origin_ remote is not created automatically.

[[remote_httpprotocol]]
=== Remote operations via HTTP

((HTTP as Git protocol))
((proxy support in Git))
It is possible to use the HTTP protocol to clone Git repositories. 
This is especially helpful if your firewall blocks everything except HTTP or HTTPS.

[source,console]
----
include::./examples/proxy/http.txt[]
----

For secured SSL encrypted communication you should use the SSH or HTTPS
protocol in order to guarantee security.

[[remote_httpproxy]]

=== Using a proxy

Git also provides support for HTTP access via a proxy server. The
following Git command could, for example, clone a repository via HTTP
and a proxy. You can either set the proxy variable in general for all
applications or set it only for Git.

The following listing configures the proxy via environment variables.

[source,console]
----
include::./examples/proxy/proxy.txt[]
----

The following listing configures the proxy via Git config settings.

[source,console]
----
include::./examples/proxy/proxy2.txt[]
----

[TIP]
====
Git is able to store different proxy configurations for
different domains, see `core.gitProxy` in
http://git-scm.com/docs/git-config[Git config manpage].
====

=== Adding a remote repository

(((Repository, add more remote repositories)))

You add as many _remotes_ to your repository as
desired. For this you use the `git remote add` command.

You created a new Git repository from scratch earlier. Use the following
command to add a remote to your new bare repository using the _origin_
name.

[source,console]
----
include::./examples/remoteadd/gitremoteadd.txt[]
---- 

[[remotes_remote_synchronize]]
=== Synchronizing with remote repositories

(((Synchronize repositories more remotes)))

You can synchronize your local Git repository with remote repositories.
These commands are covered in detail in later sections but the following
command demonstrates how you can send changes to your remote repository.

[source,console]
----
include::./examples/remoteadd/gitremotepush.txt[]
---- 

[[remotes_showremote]]

=== Show the existing remotes

(((Repository, show existing remotes)))

To see the existing definitions of the remote repositories, use the following command.

[source,console]
----
# show the details of the remote repo called origin
git remote show origin
----

To see the details of the _remotes_, e.g., the URL use the following command.

[source,console]
----
# show the existing defined remotes
git remote

# show details about the remotes
git remote -v
----

[[cloneremotes_push]]

=== Push changes to another repository

(((push)))
(((git push)))

The `git push` command allows you to send data to
other repositories. By default it sends data from your current branch to
the same branch of the remote repository.

By default you can only push to bare repositories (repositories without
working tree). Also you can only push a change to a remote repository
which results in a fast-forward merge. See <<gitmerge_fastforward>> to learn about fast-forward
merges.

See <<gitpushbranch>> for details on pushing branches or the
https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-push.html[Git push
manpage] for general information.

[[cloneremotes_pull]]

=== Pull changes from a remote repository

(((pull)))
(((git pull)))
The `git pull` command allows you to get the
latest changes from another repository for the current branch.

The `git pull` command is actually a shortcut for `git fetch` followed
by the `git merge` or the `git rebase` command depending on your
configuration. In <<autosetuprebase>> you configured your Git repository so that
`git pull` is a fetch followed by a rebase. See <<gitfetch_intro>> for more information
about the fetch command.
