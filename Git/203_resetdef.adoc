== Using Git reset for moving the HEAD pointer and updating the staging area and working tree

=== Moving the HEAD and branch pointer
(((git reset)))
Sometimes you want to change
the commmit your branch pointer is pointing to. The `git reset` command
allows you to manually set the current HEAD pointer (and its associated
branch) to a specified commit. This is for example useful to undo a
particular change or to build up a different commit history.

All commits which
were originally pointed to by the HEAD pointer and the commit pointed to
by HEAD after the reset, are _reseted_, e.g., not directly visible
anymore from the current HEAD and branch pointer.

Via parameters you can decide what you happen to the changes in the
working tree and changes which were included in the commits between the
original commit and the commit now referred to by the HEAD pointer. As a
reminder, the working tree contains the files and the staging area
contains the changes which are marked to be included in the next commit.
Depending on the specified parameters the `git reset` command performs
the following:

1.  If you specify the `--soft` parameter, the `git reset` command moves
the HEAD pointer. Changes in the working tree will be left unchanged and
all changes which were commited included in commits which are reseted
are staged.
2.  If you specify the `--mixed` parameter (the default), the
`git reset` command moves the HEAD pointer and resets the staging area
to the new HEAD. Any file change between the original commit and the one
you reset to shows up as modifications (or untracked files) in your
working tree. Use this option to remove commits but keep all the work
you have done. You can do additional changes, stage changes and commit
again. This way you can build up a different commit history.
3.  If you specify the `--hard` parameter, the `git reset` command moves
the HEAD pointer and resets the staging area and the working tree to the
new HEAD. This effectively removes the changes you have done between the
original commit and the one you reset to.

Via parameters you can define if the staging area and the working tree is updated. 
These parameters are listed in the following table.

.git reset options
|====
|Reset |Branch pointer |Working tree |Staging area
|soft |Yes |No |No
|mixed (default) |Yes |No |Yes
|hard |Yes |Yes |Yes
|====

The `git reset` command does not remove untracked files. See <<gitclean>> command for this purpose.

[[resetcommit_path]]
=== Not moving the HEAD pointer with git reset

If you specify a path via the `git reset [path]` command, Git does not move the HEAD pointer. 
It updates the staging area or also the working tree depending on your specified option.
