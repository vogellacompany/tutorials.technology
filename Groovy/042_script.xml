=== Target of this exercise
		In this exercise you learn how to create a Groovy script with the Eclipse IDE.


	[[firstgroovyscript_project">
=== Create a new Groovy script
		
			Use the Eclipse wizard to create a new
			_Groovy class_
			in your existing project.
		

		
			Remove everything from it and replace it with the following
			code.
		
		
[source,text]
----
include::res/first/HelloWorld.groovy[]
----
		

	[[firstgroovyscript_project_run">
=== Run the Groovy class
		
			Right-click your Groovy script, and select
menu:Run As[Groovy Script]
			from the context menu.
		

	[[firstgroovyscript_project_validate">
=== Validate the Groovy script
		
			The above menu entry triggers the execution of the script and prints
			output
			to
			_Console_
			view of the Eclipse IDE.
		

		 Congratulation! You created and ran your first Groovy script.
		


	[[firstgroovyscript_project_decompile">
=== Decompile the Groovy class file
		<note>
			This exercise is optional.
		
		If you are familiar with a Java decompiler, like the JadClipse
			plug-in, decompile the class
			file generated from
			your Groovy source
			file and review it.
		
		
			Ensure that it is an instance of
			`groovy.lang.Script`
			.
