== What is SonarQube
	
SonarQube (formerly Sonar) is an open source platform for continuous inspection of code quality. 
It provides a server component with a bug dashboard which allows to view and analyse reported problems in your source code.
	
Using SonarQube via Maven or Gradle is very simple and very well described on the SonarQube homepage.
See http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+Source+Code and its links for Maven or Gradle.
