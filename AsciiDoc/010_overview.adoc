== Introduction into Asciidoc

=== What is Asciidoc and Asciidoctor

AsciiDoc is a text document format for writing notes, documentation, articles, books, ebooks, slideshows, web pages, man pages and blogs. 
AsciiDoc files can be translated via the Asciidoctor toolchain to many formats including HTML, PDF, EPUB, DocBook and man page.
Any text editor can be used. 
Some websites, like Github, render AsciiDoc files directly into HTML.

The following listing is an example of a simple Asciidoc file.

----
include::res/first.adoc[]
----
<1> this is the documents title including a subtitle
<2> in the line after the title you can list the author
<3> this is the revision of the document 
<4> this attribute defines the you want to numbered sections.
<5> by default, the TOC will display only level 1 and level 2 section titles. With the toclevels attribute the level can be set differently.
<6> by default, the TOC will get the title "Table of Contents", you can set a customized name with the toc-title attribute. 
This will apply for the html and pdf output.
<7> enables experimental features, like button and menu paths
<8> adds description to the HTML output
<9> adds keywords to the HTML output
<10> Defines the default image location
Asciidoc documents typically ends with the _.adoc_. 

=== Important outstanding issues in Asciidoctor

While Asciidoctor is awesome, several outstanding issues make the usage of the PDF output difficult.
If you want to create PDF from Asciidoc, you most likely need first to create Docbook output and afterwards PDF from it.

=== Install2 the Asciidoctor toolchain

If you want to use Asciidoctor directly you have to install its toolchain. 
If you are using Gradle or Maven as build systems, it is not required to install Asciidoctor separately. 
Both Gradle or Maven provide plug-ins to execute Asciidoctor tasks.

[source, terminal]
----
sudo apt-get install -y asciidoctor

== Writing tips for great Asciidoc documents

=== One sentence per line

Try to write one sentence per line. 
This allows you to search this sentence easily and ensure you use concise descriptions which are easy to read.
This also makes it easy to move sentence around in your favorite text editor.

Based on personal experience this rule makes a great difference in the generated text. 
It helps you to avoid complex sentence structures and helps to reduce redundancy in your text.

== Basic document features

=== Title

The title is defined at the top of the .adoc file as

[source,console]
----
= Title of the document
----

=== Subtitle

If you want to define a subtitle add a `:` (a colon followed by a space) after the title

[source,console]
----
= Title of the document: This is the subtitle
----

=== Author

The Author can be written just after the title with or without an attribute. 

The author can also include information as an Email or an URL inside angle brackets.
It is possible to have a list of authors. 
Multiple authors and their emails are separated by a semicolon and a space `;`. 

Without attributes:

[source,console]
----
= Title of the document: This is the subtitle
Jennifer Nerlich <jn@vogella.com>
----

With attributes:
[source,console]
----
= Title of the document: This is the subtitle
:author: Jennifer Nerlich 
:email: jn@vogella.com
----

Asciidoctor uses the author’s name and email to assign values to built-in attributes that can be used throughout the document’s body. 
These attributes include: author (firstname and lastname), firstname, lastname, middlename, initials and email.

[source,console]
----
= Title of the document: This is the subtitle
Jennifer Nerlich <jn@vogella.com>

My first name is {firstname}.
----

If there are multiple authors you can refere to them by using the following convention: {firstname2}, {firstname3}, etc.
 
=== Revision

The revision information is listed on the third line of the .adoc document, beneath the author information line with or without attributes.
It can include the following data:

* Revision Number: It must contain at least one numeric character. 
Letters or symbols preceding the numeric character will not be rendered. 
Unless the attribute :version-label!: is set.
* Revision Date
* Revision Remark

Revision number and revision date are separated by a `,` (comma and space). 
Revison Remark is separated by a `:` (colon and space). 

Without attributes:
 
[source,console]
----
= Title of the document: This is the subtitle
Jennifer Nerlich <jn@vogella.com>
v1.1, 15.05.2017: First draft
----

With attributes:
 
[source,console]
----
= Title of the document: This is the subtitle
:revnumber: v1.1 
:revdate: 15.05.2017
:revremark: First draft
----

=== Text formatting

Use the following to highlight your text.

----
*This is bold text*

_This is cursiv text_

`This is mono text`

----

The result looks like the following:

*This is bold text*

_This is cursiv text_

`This is mono text`

=== Force line breaks

A _+_ (plus) at the end of a line with a following space forces a line break.

kbd:[&#43; + SPACE]

=== Importing files or file includes

You can import files via the include macro. 
This also works for source code includes. 
To use ---- in your listing use the [listing] style before that. 
The following example imports a file formatted as Java source code.
Via the `leveloffset` attribute you can change the section offset, for example a `=` section will become `==` if you add the following statement `:leveloffset: 1`.
Use `:leveloffset: 0` to reset the offset.

[listing]
....
[source,java]
----
\include::res/source.java[]
----
....

Result:

[source,java]
----
include::res/source.java[]
----

=== Importing files partially

It is also possible to include files partially. For this mark the part of the file to be included with a tag like the following:

....
//article.adoc
# tag::tagname[]
This should be included!
# end::tagname[]
This text will not be included!
....

and include the file with the tagname in the brackets like this:

[listing]
....
\include::article.adoc[tags=tagname]
....

The result would be

----
This should be included!
----

=== Importing images

You can import images with `image::` for the HTML output you can add the `alt` text within the brackets [].
If the image is located in the `img` folder then the import would look like this:

----
image::./img/vogellacompany.jpg[vogella Company] 
----

[NOTE] 
====
If the images are located in a certain directory, e.g. `img`, you can specify this folder in the header of your document and the import of the image will only contain the name of the image without the name of the folder.
Please note that you have to add a space between `:imagesdir:` and the name of the folder.

This would look as follows:

....
:imagesdir: ./img
image::vogellacompany.jpg[vogella Company]
....
====

The import of an image with `image::` will add the image in a new line.
If you want to add an image inline then use the macro: `image:`

....

This is just a text
image:vogellacompany.jpg[vogella Company, width=5%] to show inline images.
....

Result:

This is just a text
image:vogellacompany.jpg[vogella Company, width=5%] to show inline images.

=== Using Conditional Directives

It is possible to include or exclude text based on document attributes or based on the value of a document attribute. 
The attributes ifdef, ifndef and ifeval can be used to achieve this. 

To include content if the attribute `test` is set use the following syntax:

[source]
....
\ifdef::test[]
Content is shown when test attribute is set
\endif::test[]

or

\ifdef::test[Content is shown when include attribute is set]
....

To include content if the attribute `test` is not set, use the following syntax:

[source]
....
\ifndef::test[]
Content is shown when test attribute is NOT set
\endif::test[]
OR
\ifndef::test[Content is shown when test attribute is NOT set]
....

It is also possible to use multiple attributes.
If the attribute names are separated by a `,` (comma) only one of the attributes need to be set to include the content. 
If they are separated by a `+` (plus) all attributes must be set to include the content.

With the ifeval attribute it is possible to evaluate the value of attributes. 
If the expression is true then the content is included in the document, otherwise it is not. 

[source]
....
:version: 1 
 
\ifeval::[{version} >= 1]
This is a good one!
\endif::[]
 
\ifeval::[{version} < 1]
Work in process
\endif::[]
....

In this case the text _This is a good one!_ will be shown.


=== Defining lists

Lists can be defined with the * operator at the beginning of a line. You can define up to 6 levels for a list. 
Ensure to have a space before the list element. Example:

[source]
....
Docker allows to package the full stack in a container:

* OS
** Windows
** Ubuntu
* JVM,
* App server
* Application with its configuration
....

Result:
====
* OS
** Windows
** Ubuntu
* JVM,
* App server
* Application with its configuration
====

Numbered lists start with the .

[source]
....
. OS
.. Windows
.. Ubuntu
. JVM,
. App server
. Application with its configuration
....

Result:
====
. OS
.. Windows
.. Ubuntu
. JVM,
. App server
. Application with its configuration
====

Additional paragraphs, blocks, images, source code, etc. are adjoined to a list element by putting a plus sign (+) on a line adjacent to both blocks.

[source]
....
* Listing1
* Listing2
+
image::vote-asciidoc-issue.png[]
....

Result:
====
* Listing1
* Listing2
+
image::vote-asciidoc-issue.png[]
====

=== Menus and Buttons

You can define menus and buttons. 
This requires the activation of an experimental feature, via the *:experimental:* attribute in the header section of your document.

----
menu:View[Zoom > Reset]

Press the btn:[OK] button when you are finished.
----

The result looks like the following.

menu:View[Zoom > Reset].

Press the btn:[OK] button when you are finished.

=== Keyboard shortcuts

You can also define keyboard shortcuts with the `kbd` macro.

----
kbd:[Alt+F11] - Toggle Full Screen Mode in the Eclipse IDE
----

The result is the following:

kbd:[Alt+F11] - Toggle Full Screen Mode in the Eclipse IDE

=== Images and Graphics

To reference images in your AsciiDoc with the `image::` macro pointing to a relative file location. 
Use brackets to define a fixed or related size.

----
image::vogellacompany.jpg[200,200]
----

The result looks like the following:

image::vogellacompany.jpg[200,200]

You can also define a text for the image which is for example used for screenreaders or as placeholder if the image cannot be found.

----
image::vogellacompany.jpg[vogella Logo, 200,200]
----

If you want to scale the image for the PDF output you can use the `pdfwidth` attribute.
----
image::vogellacompany.jpg[vogella Logo,pdfwidth=40%]
----

[NOTE]
====
You can also define a default image width via the PDF theming support.
====

=== Using inline icons

You can also add the `:icons: font` directive to the top of your document, which allows you to use the icons from http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/
directory via a marco.

[source]
----
icon:comment[] This is a comment icon

icon:file[] And a file icon

icon:battery-full[] And a battery icon
----

The output looks like the following

icon:comment[] This is a comment icon

icon:file[] And a file icon

icon:battery-full[] And a battery icon


=== Defining external links

Asciidoc determines automatically links in the content of your document, if the link starts with http:// or https://. 
You can also define a anchor text via [] directly after the link.

----
http://www.vogella.com[vogella]

http://www.vogella.com
----
The result looks like the following.

http://www.vogella.com[vogella]

http://www.vogella.com

In order to include a link with white spaces or special characters as for example 

....
https://vogella.com--sa- 23345
....

the definition should look like this:

....
link:++https://vogella.com--sa- 23345++
....

=== Defining cross references

You can assign meta data to a block. Here’s an example of a quote block that includes all types of metadata:
....
.Topic Titel                                               # <1>
[[yourId]]                                                 # <2>
[yourstyle]                                                # <3>
____
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth
on this continent a new nation...

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether
that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated,
can long endure.
____
....

<1> title of the block
<2> reference for the block 
<3> can be used to style the corresponding block.

You can link to the references via, for example
....
You find more information on this in <<yourId>>.
....

[[table]]
=== Table

You can create also tables in Asciidoc via the following syntax.

----

.This is the optional title of the table
|===
|Name of Column 1 |Name of Column 2

|Cell in column 1, row 1
|Cell in column 2, row 1

|Cell in column 1, row 2
|Cell in column 2, row 2
|===
----



The result looks like the following.

.This is the optional title of the table
|===
|Name of Column 1 |Name of Column 2

|Cell in column 1, row 1
|Cell in column 2, row 1

|Cell in column 1, row 2
|Cell in column 2, row 2
|===

You can also define the relative table width.
----
.with relative column widths (1,3)
[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description
| Testing
| Table width
|===
----

Of course you can define tables with more than two columns.

----

.Title
|===
|Name of Column 1 |Name of Column 2 |Name of Column 3 

|Cell in column 1, row 1
|Cell in column 2, row 1
|Cell in column 3, row 1

|Cell in column 1, row 2
|Cell in column 2, row 2
|Cell in column 3, row 2
|===
----


==== Define column widths

The `[cols="1,3"]` declaration directly underneath the .declaration can be used to specify the column's width.
If the width is set then the option="header" must also be set like this: [cols="1,3",options="header"] in order to see
the first row of a table as a header.

----

.Title
[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
|Name of Column 1 |Name of Column 2 |Name of Column 3 

|Cell in column 1, row 1
|Cell in column 2, row 1
|Cell in column 3, row 1

|Cell in column 1, row 2
|Cell in column 2, row 2
|Cell in column 3, row 2
|===
----

The snippet above will result in the following:

.Title
[cols="1, 3",options="header"]
|===
|Name of Column 1 |Name of Column 2

|Cell in column 1, row 1
|Cell in column 2, row 1

|Cell in column 1, row 2
|Cell in column 2, row 2
|===

Alternatively % values can be used, e.g., [cols="40%, 60%"].

In order to add special asciidoc elements as lists, notes, sourcecode, etc. within a table cell just add an `a` before the `|`. 
Some elements like keyboard shortcuts(kbd) and buttons(btn) do not need a special definition in tables.
This would look like this:

----

.with asciidoc elements 
|===
|Keyboard shortcut |List |Note |Button 

|kbd:[Ctrl+9]
a|* Test 1
* Test 2
* Test 3
a|
[NOTE]
====
This is a good idea
====
|btn:[OK]

|===
----

.with asciidoc elements 
|===
|Keyboard shortcut |List |Note |Button

|kbd:[Ctrl+9]
a|* Test 1
* Test 2
* Test 3
a|
[NOTE]
====
This is a good idea
====
|btn:[OK]

|===

[[source-code]]
=== Source code, using monospace and callouts

Use monospace text formatting to emulate how source code appears in computer terminals, 
simple text editors, and integrated development environments (IDEs). 
Enclose the starting hypthen string with \ for this, e.g., \`System.out.println("Hello");` results in `System.out.println("Hello");` 

To enable syntax highlighting in the output, set the style on the block to source and specify the source language in the second attribute position. 
The possible highlighting styles are described in chapter <<highlighting>>.

....
[source, java]
----
include::res/test.java
----
....

The supported languages depends on your renderer but your can for example use:

* console - for terminal output
* java - for Java source files


It is also very simple to add callouts, as demonstrated by the following snippet.
	
....
[source, java, numbered]
----
System.out.println("Hello");  # \<1>
private int a;
----
<1> Imports the library
....

Output is the following

[source, java, numbered]
----
System.out.println("Hello");  # <1>
private int a;
----

<1> Imports the library

Supported types are java, xml, terminal

NOTE: Asciidoc automatically replaces tabs in source code with spaces.
You can set the amount of spaces to be set per tab with the attribute `:tabsize: 2`.
In this case one tab will be replaced with 2 spaces.

[[highlighting]]
==== Source code highlighting

Syntax highlighting can be used by setting the source-highlighter attribute in the document header.

`:source-highlighter: pygments`

The valid options for html styling are coderay, highlightjs, prettify and pygments.
For pfd styling coderay, rouge and pygments are available.

coderay, rouge and pygments work with an embedded css styling which will be added to the folder of the *.adoc file during the output conversion. 
In this case the attribute `:linkcss:` must be set in the document header.
highlightjs and prettify use javascript.

For pygments, highlightjs, prettify there are a variaty of different styles/themes.
 
To use a pygment style add the following attribute to the document header:

`:pygments-style: xcode` 

If you dont set the pygment-style attribute, the default style will be used.

To see the list of all available pygments styles execute: `pygmentize -L styles` in the command line.

As for hightlightjs the styles are called themes and can be added to the docuemnt header as follows:

`:highlightjs-theme: xcode`


=== Escape special signs

If you need to escape Asciidoc commands, you can use `\` before the character that would normally be interpreted by Asciidoc.
To write for example `|` you would need to write it like this: `\|`.

=== Index

You can add primary index terms to your document via +++(((yourterm)))+++. 
A secondary index can be added to your document via +++(((yourterm, secondary term2)))+++. 
For example:

+++((((Big cats)))+++

+++((((Big cats, Lions)))+++

=== Comments in Asciidoc

We can add comments to the Asciidoc markup. 
The comments are not added to the generated output. 
You can use both single and multiline comments. 
Single line comments start with a double slash (//). 
Multiline comments are enclosed in a block of four forward slashes (////).

=== Escape Asciidoc markup

Most AsciiDoc elements can be escaped by preceding them with a backslash character.

=== Custom attributes / variables

You can define custom variables and use them in your document. 
For example the following defines the variable `yourvariable` which can be used with \{yourvariable\} and Asciidoctor will replace it with the value defined after the second :.

----
:yourvariable: vogella
----
