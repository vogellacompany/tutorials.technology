== Using the Gradle wrapper
	
		The idea of the Gradle wrapper is that a user should not need to install Gradle to run the build with a predefined
		version and settings of Gradle.
		The
		_Gradle Wrapper_
		(wrapper) is a batch
		script on Windows, and
		a shell script for other
		operating systems. When you start a Gradle
		build via
		the wrapper, the specified version of
		Gradle is
		automatically downloaded and
		used to run the build.
	
	
		The wrapper is the preferred way of
		starting a Gradle build, as it make the execution of the build independent of the
		installed Gradle version.
		The
		wrapper script can be created via
		`gradle wrapper`
		.
	
	
		As a result you find a
		_gradlew_
		for *nix based systems and
		_gradlew.bat_
		for window systems. These files can be used instead for the
		`gradle`
		command, and if Gradle is not installed on the machine, Gradle is
		automatically downloaded and installed.
	
	
		It is
		also possible to define a task which defines the version of
		the
		wrapper. If this task is executed it creates
		the wrapper and
		downloads the correct version of Gradle.

	The version of the Gradle Wrapper can also be defined, when
		creating it via the command line.
	
	
		`&gt; gradle wrapper --gradle-version 2.9`
	
	Without this explicit version parameter gradle will automatically
		pick the latest version.

=== Configure GRADLE_OPTS for the Gradle wrapper
		
			GRADLE_OPTS can also be defined inside the
			_gradlew_
			or
			_gradlew.bat_
			file
