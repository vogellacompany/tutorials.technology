== Installing and configuring Gradle

=== Requirements

(((Gradle, Installation)))
The usage of Gradle requires an JDK (Java Development Kit) installation.
	
=== Download and extract Gradle
		
The latest version of Gradle can be found on the http://gradle.org/gradle-download[Gradle Download page].
Download the latest _Complete distribution_.
		
It is a gradle-${version}-all.zip, where ${version} is a placeholder for the current version.

Extract the contents of the downloaded zip file a new folder.
		
=== Installing Gradle on Windows
		
Add the folder to which you extracted Gradle to your `PATH` environment variable.
		
By pressing Win + Pause the system settings can be opened.

First the _Advanced System Settings_ have to be selected and then the btn:[Environment Variables] button needs to be pressed.

In the _Environment Variables_ dialog the (1) GRADLE_HOME and JAVA_HOME user variables should be set.
After that the (2) Path entry in the _system variables_ is selected, the btn:[modify] button can be pressed to add the _bin_ folder of the Gradle installation to the Path.

=== Installing Gradle on Linux/Mac

==== Manual installation
		
The `JAVA_HOME` variable must point to a proper jdk and `$JAVA_HOME/bin` must be part of the PATH environment variable.
		
Add Gradle to the path by running `export PATH=/usr/local/gradle/FOLDER_TO_WHICH_YOU_EXTRACTED_GRADLE/bin:$PATH` in a terminal.
		
==== Installation with SDKMAN!

SDKMAN! is a command-line tool that allows you to install multiple Gradle versions and switch between them.
It runs on any UNIX based operating system.

===== Installing SDKMAN!

You install it from the command-line. If you have already installed SDKMAN! you can skip this step.

[source, commandline]
----
include::res/install/sdkman_install[]
----

After you've installed SDKMAN! you have to restart you terminal before using it.

===== Installing Gradle and setting default version

[source, commandline]
----
include::res/install/sdkman_install_gradle[]
include::res/gradle/check_version[]
----

===== Switching Gradle version

[source, commandline]
----
include::res/install/sdkman_switch_version[]
include::res/gradle/check_version[]
----

==== Check if Gradle installation was successful
		
Open a command line and type `gradle`, which will run Gradle's help task by default.

=== Using the Gradle daemon for improved startup time
		
Gradle allows to start Gradle as daemon to avoid starting the Java virtual machine for every build. 
To configure that create a file called _gradle.properties_ in the _${HOME}/.gradle_ and add the following line to it.gradle.properties.
		
[source,console]
----
include::res/install/gradle.properties[]
----
		
You can also place the _gradle.properties_ file to the root directory of your project and commit it to your version control system.
		
If Gradle is not used for a few hours, the daemon stops automatically.
		
Executing gradle with the `--daemon` parameter on the command line starts the gradle daemon.
		
To stop the daemon interactively use the `gradle --stop` command.

=== Specify custom JVM settings for Gradle

The GRADLE_OPTS environment variable offers the opportunity to set specific JVM options for Gradle.
		
In <<gradeinstallation_demon>> the performance for the JVM startup is improved, but another performance killer for large builds can be a too small maximum heap space. 
Therefore it makes sense to increase it for Gradle.
		
`export GRADLE_OPTS=-Xmx1024m`
defines that Gradle can use 1 GB as maximum heap size.
		
On Windows OS environment variables are usually defined via the system property UI.
		
=== Typical .gitignore file for Gradle projects
		
If you are using Git as version control system, you can use the following _.gitignore_ file as template for a Gradle project.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/git/gitignore[]
