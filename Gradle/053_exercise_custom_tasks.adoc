== Exercise: Create Custom Gradle Tasks

=== Exercise: Specifying a Wrapper Task

Gradle's Wrapper Task can be implemented like this:

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/wrapper/wrappertask.gradle[]
----
	
=== Exercise: Creating a Copy Task
The `Copy` task type can be used to specify a task, which is able to copy files.


Create a new project with the following _build.gradle_ file:

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/tasks/copy_task_type.gradle[]
----

Create a _source_ folder inside this project and add a text file to this folder.

When running the `copyFile` task it copies the text file to a new _destination_ folder.

	
=== Exercise: Specifying a custom Task in another gradle file

Create a new Gradle project, which contains the following structure.

image::buildSrc_Tasks.png[]
	

The _CheckWebsite.groovy_ class looks like this:

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/tasks/CheckWebsite.groovy[]
----


Since this class has external dependencies to jsoup, a _build.gradle_ file for this class has to be created.


So the _build.gradle_ inside the _buildSrc_ folder, which is responsible for building the `CheckWebsite` class, looks like this:


[source,gradle]
----
include::res/tasks/buildSrcCheckWebsite.gradle[]
----

Finally the main _build.gradle_ file in the root folder makes use of the new `com.example.CheckWebsite` task type.

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/tasks/Checkwebsite.gradle[]
----
