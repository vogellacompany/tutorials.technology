[[derby_modes]]
=== Server vs. embedded mode

Derby can be used in a
server mode and in so-called
_embedded mode_.
If
Derby runs in the server mode
you start the Derby network
server
which
will be responsible for
handling the database requests. In
_embedded mode_
Derby runs
within the
JVM (Java Virtual
Machine)
of
the
application. In
this mode
only the application can
access the
database, e.g. another
user /
application will not be able
to access
the database.
