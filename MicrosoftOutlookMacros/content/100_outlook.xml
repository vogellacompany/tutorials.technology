=== Create automatically greetings for email receiver
		 The following macro describes how you can extract information
			from the email and create a corresponding message in your email text.
			For example if you are writting to Jim.Test@example.com you can
			create a text in your email "Hi Jim,....Best regards, Lars" and place
			the cursor in the right place to start typing.
		
		 The following macro reads all email addresses in the To part of
			the email. Then is extracts the part before the first "." assumes that
			this is the first name and writes Hello firstname1, firstname2,...
		
		 It also puts in "Best regards, Lars" and places the cursor on
			the right position to reply. The macro allows also to set a defined
			delay in sending out the email.
